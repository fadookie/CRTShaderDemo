# CRT Shader Demo

This isn't so much a demo of a finished shader as much as research into compositing techniques. It's a work in progress to help a fellow developer learn about these topics.

## Instructions

Make sure to run the game for the animations to work properly.

Play around with the `CRT Material` asset at runtime to see how tweaking different constants changes the shader behavior.
